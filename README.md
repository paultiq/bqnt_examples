# Overview

These examples show how we (Iqmo) use Bloomberg's BQuant Enterprise service.

The examples vary from basic data display to interactive applications. Various security universes are demonstrated, including equities and fixed income.

Note: Most of them will not work in BQuant Desktop (from Terminal), as they have additional dependencies that must be installed.

# Usage

- Launch BQuant Enterprise
- Create a new Custom Environment
  - Add "nbappinator" and "iql" to the Custom Environment
  - Click "Solve" and "Save"
- Launch a New Project with the Custom Environment you created
- Clone the repository: either using the GUI or manually using `!git clone https://github.com/paultiq/bqnt_examples`
